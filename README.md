StagePlot v2 (v1.6 - rainbow)

StagePlot v2 is a fast, offline-capable stage plot builder for bands, venues, and sound engineers.

Drag people and gear onto a stage, label inputs and monitor mixes, pinch to scale items, fine-tune with nudge controls and exact width/depth sizing, color-code boxes (even in multi-select), and print a clean one-page handoff (or save it as a PDF). No accounts, no drama, just “here is the plot, please do not mic the tambourine.”

Whats new in v1.6 (rainbow)
	•	Box color is back - set color for a selected item and yes, for multi-select too
	•	Pinch-to-scale on touch screens for the selected item
	•	Selected item tools under the stage - nudge + size + scale in one spot
	•	Item sizing controls now support both gesture and sliders, plus numeric width/depth
	•	Reset is back (real reset) - clear/clean the stage properly, not just a button that vibes quietly

⸻

What it does
	•	Build a stage diagram in real-world feet or meters (toggle anytime)
	•	Set stage size using presets (Small, Medium, Large) or custom Width/Depth
	•	Add musicians and gear from a built-in library plus quick “Misc” blocks
	•	Drag to place items, multi-select items, duplicate, delete
	•	Pinch to scale items (touch) or use Scale sliders (desktop or mobile)
	•	Adjust item footprint with Width/Depth controls
	•	Rotate items and reset rotation
	•	Color-code boxes for quick visual grouping (backline, wedges, power, etc.)
	•	Auto-generate readable Inputs and Monitor Mix lists
	•	Add show notes and per-item notes for the one-page print sheet
	•	Flip between Stage View and Audience View
	•	View Zoom lets you zoom your view for precise placement without changing real scale
	•	Export and import a project JSON to share or archive
	•	Print a clean one-page sheet

⸻

Quick tips
	•	Click an item to select it
	•	Shift, Cmd, or Ctrl click to multi-select
	•	Drag selected items to move as a group
	•	Touch screens: select an item, then pinch on the item to scale it
	•	Nudge: use the on-screen arrows or Shift + Arrow keys
	•	View Zoom is just your camera, not the actual stage size

Printing

Hit Print to generate a clean handoff. For best results, keep View Zoom at 100 percent (Print auto-temporarily resets view to 100 percent so your plot doesnt print like you were zoomed in on a single wedge like its a nature documentary).

⸻

Export and import
	•	Export saves a JSON file with stage settings, items, labels, notes, and colors
	•	Import restores a saved project (backward-friendly migrations included)

⸻

Tech notes
	•	Offline friendly (runs as a single static page)
	•	Autosaves to localStorage
	•	Internal units are feet for consistency; meters are a display toggle
	•	Works on desktop, tablet, and phone

⸻

Roadmap ideas
	•	Snap-to-grid toggle
	•	Alignment tools (line up, distribute)
	•	Better grouping labels (color legend or tags)
	•	Export as PDF button (one-tap)
